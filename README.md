 [ ] Choosing appropriate units; precision
 [ ] Know terms, factors, coefficients
 [ ] Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. Include equations arising from linear , quadratic, and exponential functions with integer exponents.


 
     [ ] Represent constraints by equations or inequalities, and by systems of equations and/or inequalities, and interpret solutions as viable or nonviable options in a modeling context. For example, represent inequalities describing nutritional and cost constraints on combinations of different foods
     [ ] Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest, using the same reasoning as in solving equations. For example, rearrange Ohmâ€™s law V = IR to highlight resistance R. Tasks are limited to linear, quadratic, piecedwise, absolute value, and exponential equations with integer exponents.
     [ ] Solve linear equations and inequalities in one variable, including equations with coefficients represented by letters.
     [ ] For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the relationship. Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and minimums; symmetries and end behavior. Tasks are limited to linear, quadratic, absolute value, and exponential functions with domains in the integers.
     [ ] Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to another set (called the range) assigns to each element of the domain exactly one element of the range. If f is a function and x is an element of its domain, then f(x) denotes the output of f corresponding to the input x. The graph of f is the graph of the equation y = f(x).
     [ ] Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context.
     [ ] Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems.Tasks are limited to linear, quadratic, or exponential equations with integer exponents.
     [ ] Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and
geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs. Tasks are limited to constructing linear and exponential functions in simple context (not multi-step).
